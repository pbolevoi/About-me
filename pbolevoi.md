# The path to ambassador |
I'll tell you a little about myself <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/72/apple/325/backhand-index-pointing-down_light-skin-tone_1f447-1f3fb_1f3fb.png" width="15"/>

As of today, my goal is to become a Crypto Ambassador! Even though I'm new to it, I have a passion for this activity and I quickly learn new materials and tasks. "Ambassadors school" helps and instructs my way to an ambassador.

I opened up to the world of cryptocurrencies in the summer of 2020, before the bull run. Throughout that time, I was learning something new and following the market and news. As it should be, being a newbie, I lost my first deposit and got wise. After that, I devoted myself to participation in ICO and held several nodes. Now I see myself in the role of an ambassador and make efforts to make it happen.
